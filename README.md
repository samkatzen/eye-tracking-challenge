# eye-tracking-challenge

In this task I was told to add a second "eye" element and have that element follow the mouse position on the screen using the mouse events.

The starter code provided a templete of one eye that was static.

To use this challenge all you need to do is hover your mouse over the page and eyes will follow. 

Some future improvements I could make is the ability to change the eye color on click.
